            <!-- Preface -->
            <!-- <div class="preview-page">
                <h3 class="page-title">PREFACE</h3>
                <p class="preview-text">For many years, I have volunteered with various MSAs, masajid, and Islamic institutes. During that time, I have met people from all kinds of backgrounds, each carrying their own struggles. In private conversations, they would open up about school, work, family, health, and moments when life felt overwhelming. Often, they didn't realize that one of the most powerful solutions to their challenges could be found in Tahajjud, the night prayer.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">This book shares success stories of ordinary people who turned to Allah at night, praying for a new job, better health, love, success in exams, or the ability to start and nurture a family. Through these prayers, they achieved outcomes that often seemed miraculous: recovering from long-term illness, finding a life partner after years of searching, overcoming financial hardships that nearly broke them, or finally starting a family after repeated challenges.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">These stories reveal a simple but powerful truth: Tahajjud is not just for the exceptionally pious. It is a hidden gem in every believer's arsenal, accessible to all, often overlooked, and capable of transforming any struggle while strengthening our connection with Allah.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">By reading these stories, you can see the power of Tahajjud in action. Ordinary people have used it to seek Allah's help, guidance, and relief in their daily struggles, and you can unlock the same power for yourself. Turning to Allah at night can bring blessings, solutions, and a deeper connection with Him that we all seek.</p>

            <div class="preview-page">
                <h3 class="page-title">Chapter One</h3>
                <h4 class="page-subtitle">Illusion of Control</h4>
                
                <p class="preview-text">Life rarely goes as we imagine. We make plans, work hard, and try to prepare for every outcome, yet there are moments when events slip beyond our control. It can feel frustrating, helpless, and even frightening. We all have areas in our lives where control seems just out of reach—circumstances that no amount of effort or preparation can fully manage.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">In this chapter, we examine that reality through different experiences. One story follows a husband as he navigates profound challenges in his family life, confronting situations he cannot change, no matter how much he wishes he could. The other tells of a man imprisoned, physically confined and at the mercy of decisions far beyond his control. Both journeys show that life can push us to limits we never expected, testing our patience, resilience, and faith.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">These stories reveal a key truth: control is often just an illusion. We might feel trapped by circumstances, burdened by uncertainty, or even powerless when outcomes depend on others or on external factors. Still, even in those moments, there is a chance to grow, to strengthen our hearts, and to deepen our connection with Allah, especially through Tahajjud.</p>

            <div class="preview-page">
                <h4 class="story-title">Please, God… Don't Take Her Away</h4>
                
                <p class="preview-text">I used to be a Christian, but alhamdulillah, I found my way to Islam through reading the Quran and watching lectures online. That's how everything started shifting for me—reading verses that touched my soul, listening to scholars explain the beauty of the religion. But right in the middle of all that, my wife got sick. It wasn't just any illness; it was a complete mess of medical issues that the doctors struggled to identify.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">We married out of love, old friends who knew each other's hearts inside out, both Christians at the time. Our daughter was born, this little mirror of her mum, with the same bright eyes and that laugh that could light up a room.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">Life moved quickly. I had our daughter to care for—she was still so young—the job that paid the bills, and the house that needed managing. When my wife's condition worsened, they quickly admitted her to the hospital. I dropped our daughter off at her grandmother's every morning, then went straight to the hospital to stay in that cramped guest room by her side.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">One afternoon, the doctor pulled me aside in the hallway, his face serious as he laid it out: "Your wife doesn't have much time left." Those words hit me hard like a truck. I stumbled back to the room, kept it together until she drifted off to sleep, then I fell apart.</p>
                
                <p class="preview-text">That's when Tahajjud became my lifeline. During those hours before sunrise, when the house was silent, and the weight of everything pressed hardest, I'd rise for prayer. I'd make wudu with cold water that jolted me awake, spread out my prayer mat in the dim light of the lamp, and pour my heart out to Allah...</p>
